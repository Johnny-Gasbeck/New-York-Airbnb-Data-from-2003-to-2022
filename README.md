# New-York-Airbnb-Data-from-2003-to-2022
Analyze the relationship between Airbnb listing prices, review ratings, and property characteristics.

# Goal

The goal of this project was to **analyze the relationship between Airbnb listing prices, review ratings, and property characteristics** using Excel. This project will involve **data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization** to determine how property features influence both pricing and guest satisfaction. Identifying these relationships can help Airbnb hosts make data-driven decisions to **maximize revenue and improve guest experience.** By understanding which factors contribute to higher pricing and better ratings, hosts can strategically enhance their properties and optimize pricing. Ultimately, this analysis provides insights that can lead to **increased bookings, higher profitability, and long-term success on the platform.**


# Process

I sourced an Airbnb dataset containing listing details, including prices, review ratings, and property characteristics, and imported it into **Excel** for cleaning and analysis. To prepare the data, I **removed duplicates and standardized column formats for consistency.** Using **Excel functions and filters**, I ensured data accuracy and categorized property features for better analysis. I then **analyzed the relationship between listing prices, review ratings, and property characteristics using PivotTables** to  identify trends. Finally, I **visualized the insights using PivotCharts and Slicers**, highlighting pricing patterns, review ratings, and key property attributes that influence Airbnb success


# Key Findings

1. Neighborhoods significantly influenced Airbnb prices, while room type had a moderate impact. Cancellation policy had minimal effect, indicating that guests are willing to spend more for specific locations and accommodation types over booking flexibility.
2. Neighborhoods strongly influenced Airbnb review ratings, while room type had a moderate impact. Cancellation policy played a minor role, suggesting guests prioritize location and accommodation type over booking flexibility.
